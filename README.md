# rosalind_solution_set
 A repository with my solutions to **Rosalind** Bioinformatics questions.

* The source of the questions is [rosalind.info](https://rosalind.info/).
* All my answers are written in Python.
* Each notebook consists of four sections:
   - **Source**: Link to question, screenshot of problem, sample input and output.
   - **Workspace**: The part where different approaches are studied using given sample data set/s; exploration of data and problem.
     - Based on problem needs and input data character, quick speed or memory usage tests.
   - **Implementation**: Implementation of agreed upon solution.
   - **Execution**: Execution of implemented function/s. Answers are written to both the console and a file.

### External Libraries

Some external Python libraries may be necessary to execute the notebooks without any error. The latest versions of each package should work well.

* `biopyhton`
* `pandas`
* `numpy`
* `stats`
