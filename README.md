* Each notebook consists of four sections:
   - **Source**: Link to the question, screenshot of problem, sample input and output.
   - **Workspace**: The part where different approaches are studied using given sample data set/s; exploration of data and problem.
   - **Implementation**: Implementation of agreed upon solution.
